<div class="pres animated slideInUp">
<br/>
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<br/>
<section class="informacion"><p>
Our main recommendation is that you optimize your time by looking for the most cost-effective way to invest it, you may have noticed, through the previous captures, that the most profitable method of winning SB is through <strong>surveys</strong> and free <strong>offers</strong> and paid. While you can spend about 15 minutes to see a list of 20 videos and win 3 SB as a bonus or win 75 SB for a 15 minute survey, seen in this way is much more profitable survey; but above all this is personal taste, that is, if it is your thing to watch videos and play, then do it and enjoy doing it, the good thing about <strong>Swagbucks</strong> is the great number of ways to make <strong>money</strong> and, something very important, all ways work.<br/><br/>
If you've noticed the section of <forte>surveys</forte> you should take some care when answering the first survey, which is the survey of our profile; here's what we explain:<br/><br/>
The surveys are aimed at consumers and have a purchasing power that allows them to access different services or products, this we recommend you keep in mind when you fill out the first survey, which as we said before, will be the survey of your profile, where you'll be asked your age, marital status, your occupation and income; and to keep that information consistent with the other surveys you respond to; you should also be aware that you'll not be able to respond to all surveys because we'll not always meet the profile when answering pre-qualification questions for each survey. If you're interested in learning more about this topic we invite you to read what is written in the section of GreenPanthera, in which we thoroughly discuss the topics of a good profile and prequalification questions.
<br/><br/>
Also worth mentioning is the availability of the search engine Swagbucks, through which we'll earn a certain amount of SB, it'll not be a huge amount but it is an extra income that no one hurts. To get more information about this you can do it by clicking on Find in the menu located to the left of the platform and then click on <forte>More information</forte> next to the phrase <forte>Members earn more when they set up Swagbucks as their search engine.</forte>
<br/><br/>
As a final recommendation we let you say that you enjoy the platform, taking advantage of its good aesthetic and really having fun with Swagbucks. We hope you've fun and have a great time.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<br/>
<section class="informacion">
<p class="linkextra">What are pre-qualification questions?</p><p> These are the questions that we're asked within a survey to determine if we're good study subjects for the specific survey; that is, we can enter a survey, ask a couple of questions and according to the answers we give, we can access the survey or not; here also applies what we've said before, being a person of consumption, we'll be more likely to be able to access the survey, however, on many occasions we'll not be able to qualify surveys being this the most normal, which is why there is no why bother or be discouraged. We also recommend having patience because most of the time the prequalification questions are the same questions that you filled in your profile, this is because the clients, that is, those who perform the surveys, seek consistency in the answers and are not taken to the light the information we give; Finally it is worth noting that in the prequalification questions we'll not take more than 5 minutes to answer them since it would be unfair to invest 30 minutes in prequalification questions to finally be disqualified.<br/><br/>
</p>
<p class="linkextra">If I don't live in accepted countries can I use VPN?</p><p> We don't recommend it because if you use a paid or free VPN service you'll be using an IP address of a country that's accepted, until then everything is fine, the problem is that you'll not be the only one to use this new IP address, since that there will be many more people with Swagbucks account making use of the same IP address. Well we could say that yes you can use VPN but we would only be taking advantage of your good intentions, however we invite you to continue browsing my-money.online, surely find something that you like and that you can do with total security.<br/><br/>
</p><p class="linkextra">I don't have PayPal account </p><p>No problem, the first thing you've to do is go to the PayPal page, we don't provide the link for your own security, once there, at the top you'll find the following options:<br/>

<section class="informacion">
<p>Later you will be asked your gender and tastes and then your personal data and finally, they will ask you if you want to associate your bank card, being able to postponed if you want to do so by clicking on <forte>I'll do it later</forte>, and can use Visa, MasterCard, Diners Club or American Express. We leave you a link through which you can access the FAQ page of PayPal related to the use of the card.</p>
