<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
<br/>
<section class="informacion">
<p>In order to avoid problems due to ignorance of the Spare5 rules, we want to explain what is, in our opinion, the most important thing that's mentioned in the terms and conditions of this platform; if you want to know more in depth about the conditions of the service of Spare5, you can accede to them by means of the following link: <a href="https://mty.ai/webview-terms-of-service/" target='_blank'>Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>

It is also mentioned that Spare5 doesn't run the transaction costs for PayPal, although in this case this issue doesn't take more importance because, for these transactions, PayPal doesn't charge any commission.</p>

	<h2>Main tasks</h2>
	<br/>
	<img class="ima" src="../img/inicial.png" title="Most common initial tasks" alt="Initial Tasks in Spare5">
	<section class="informacion"><p>The ones you've just observed are usually the <strong>tasks</strong> that you're given when you're just beginning, they explain how to perform some tasks with tutorials, but don't worry about those who don't have a tutorial, when you start each task, you're given instructions to do it as well you'll have better performance in all your tasks and you'll be able to get better payments as you gain experience, clarifying that a considerable percentage of tasks are translated in the language of your country.</p>
	<br/><br/>
	<p>There are 4 types of tasks in Spare5, then we explain in detail each one of them:</p><br/><br/>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td><p class="linkextra">Tutorials:</p> These tasks aren't remunerated, you can do them as many times as you want if you want to learn for future tasks or if you forgot how to do some, although they aren't paid, we recommend doing them at the beginning, when you don't have so many tasks to do, since this type of Tasks teach you how to do tasks that, based on our experience, appear more frequently, in addition to giving you experience points, that is, help you increase your options of receiving a paid task.</td>
			<td class="img"><img class="ima" src="../img/tuto.png" title="Tutorial example" alt="Tutorial task on Spare5"></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td class="img"><img class="ima" src="../img/train.png" title="Training Example" alt="Spare5 training task"></td>
			<td><p class="linkextra">Training:</p> These tasks are very similar to the tutorials, many of them are paid only the first time you do them and some are never paid, but you can do them as many times as you want to improve your skills.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td><p class="linkextra">Qualification:</p> These tasks are necessary to unlock paid tasks, you need to perform them with 100% accuracy so that they qualify as approved, if you don't approve the first attempt, don't worry, you can do it again 48 hours later, when you approve it, will unlock a task with payment in addition to give you experience as well.</td>
			<td class="imag"><img class="imag" src="../img/calif.png" title="Qualification Example" alt="Qualification task at Spare5"><img class="imag" src="../img/lock.png" title="Task that unlocks when doing qualification" alt="Task locked in Spare5"></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td class="img"><img class="ima" src="../img/pagas.png" title="Paid task example" alt="Paid task on Spare5"></td>
			<td><p class="linkextra">Paid tasks:</p> These are the ones that interest us all, right?, These tasks bring experience, but most importantly, your Spare5 profits increase between 1 and 5 cents, in most cases, they're very simple and won't take you more than 30 seconds, they're usually for a while and disappear, so be aware. When you enter the task for the first time, they give you instructions and they tell you what to do and how to do it, pay attention to the instructions to have a high percentage of success and a better payment, plus, if you do well, very you'll probably get that kind of task again.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>From our experience we can tell you that the better you complete the tasks, the more you'll come, as your performance in these tasks will be reviewed by those who raise them.</p>

	<br/>
	<h2>About payment</h2>
	<br/>
	<section class="informacion"><p>In <strong>Spare5</strong> you don't need to request payment for your work, the payment is sent weekly to your PayPal account, which you can enter at the time of registration or at any later time, yes, before receiving the first payment; what you'll receive will be the amount that you gather for a week, from Wednesday to Wednesday, and the payment will arrive the following Friday. Later you'll be able to find payment vouchers that we've received, as you can see, the amount depends on how much you work during the week, if you do it constantly and with the maximum possible success, you'll receive very good <strong>payments</strong>, but during the week you must get at least 1 USD, something really simple to get, for you to get the payment, otherwise, you'll accumulate for the next week and you can charge it.</p>
