<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
<br/>
<section class="informacion">
<p>With this we want to prevent you from naivety because, citing the maxim of civil law, </p><p class="ita">"Ignorance of the law doesn't exempt it from compliance"</p><p>, below we discuss important points of the terms and conditions of GreenPanthera:</p>
</section>
<img class="ima" src="../img/ingles/gp2.png" title = "GreenPanthera Terms and Conditions" alt = "GreenPanthera Terms">
<section class="informacion2"><ul>
<i>1. <p class="linkextra">You may only have one account per household:</p><p>This means that only one account per IP address is allowed, this means that only one person can have an account at home; to make it clearer, if in your house, you and 3 other people create account in GreenPanthera, all accounts will be blocked when verifying that these accounts come from the same IP address; block may not be generated immediately but sooner or later.</p></i><br/><br/>
<i>2. <p class="linkextra">If you don't use our links to place your order and order directly through site or over the phone or through another source, you'll not receive a rebate from us:</p><p>It means that if we want to receive reimbursement for our purchases we must first enter our GreenPanthera account and from the stores section, choose the store in which we want to make the purchase.</p></i><br/><br/>
<i>3. <p class="linkextra">You must answer all questions truthfully and not rush through the questions:</p><p>This is very important because if it is determined that we've not responded honestly, we'll not receive a bonus for the survey. Usually within the surveys they repeat the questions, this in order to determine if we're really reading what is asked, in this way if we've paid attention to the questions, both questions, that is, the repeated ones, will have the same answer; also usually happens that in some question we're asked to choose a specific option, equally in order to determine if we're being attentive.</p></i><br/><br/>
<i>4. <p class="linkextra">If you qualify and complete it successfully, you'll receive credit within a few business days once we verify your successful completion:</p><p>The first thing we've to be very clear is that we'll not be able to respond to all surveys, why? Because we'll not always be part of the population that a specific survey wants to study, we'll try to explain it with an example: Let us suppose two surveys, survey # 1 and survey # 2; survey # 1 needs to do a study on people who exercise between 4 and 8 hours a week and survey # 2 seeks to do a study on people who perform more than 8 hours of exercise in the week in this way and assuming that we do 6 hours of exercise per week, we can only respond to survey # 1; this is possible because the respondents make use of initial questions, pre-qualification questions, to determine if we meet the desired profile; in our example, an initial question to determine if we meet the profile would be how many hours per week do you spend on physical activity? If we respond honestly to this question in both surveys the result will be that we'll be able to conduct survey # 1; On the other hand, if we're not honest, we can say that in survey # 1 we respond that we perform 9 hours of exercise and in survey # 2, 7 hours, which is why we'll not meet the profile at any; we hope the example has clarified your doubts.</p></i></ul></section>
<section class="informacion">
<p>Now, with regard to payment, we allow you to recommend that you've patience, may receive the bonus for a survey in the next two business days and receive it in two weeks, again we remind you that what we write here is based on our experience as well as the questions we've asked GreenPanthera customer service through your e-mail, here we should highlight the kindness and attention of your answers. We discuss these issues a little more thoroughly in the Frequently Asked Questions section.</p></section>
<section class="informacion2">
<ul>
<i>5. <p class="linkextra">Membership in Greenpanthera.com is limited to one account per household per IP:</p><p>Again we're reminded that only one account per IP address is allowed, informing us that, in case of finding multiple accounts, they'll all be eliminated without paying the bonus.</p></i><br/><br/>
<i>6. <p class="linkextra">You must have a minimum of 30$ in order to redeem your rewards:</p><p>Here there won't much to say, as specified, the minimum balance to be withdrawn is 30 USD, it may seem a lot but you've to keep in mind that by the record only we start with 5 USD and that the payment we receive by every survey is pretty good, so there's no reason to be discouraged, much less be negative.</p></i><br/><br/>
<i>7. <p class="linkextra">Withdrawals take 4-10 business days to process:</p><p>This tells us that at the time of requesting the payment of the bonus, it'll take between 4 and 10 days. The balance is paid to PayPal and this must be verified, ie have a valid card.</p></i><br/><br/></ul>

<br/>
<h2>Referral system</h2>
<br/>
<section class="informacion"><p>In <strong>GreenPanthera</strong> you can invite friends to be part of this platform of surveys, for it is enough that copies your unique and personal link and you send it to your friend in question; for our case, that is, our link, we've enclosed it in the following image.</p>
</section>
<img class="ima" src="../img/ingles/gp6.png" title = "GreenPanthera referral system" alt = "Invite GreenPanthera friends">
<section class="informacion">
<p>This way, when your friend clicks on your invitation link and registers completely, it'll appear on your friends list, which is just below your invitation link. The referral system in GreenPanthera has no referral limit and one level, receiving as a gift, 10% of your friend's bonuses for life; here we'll try to explain very well this aspect because we understand that you can have doubts in this particular subject:
<br/><br/>
Suppose Emily invites her beloved neighbor Jack and his best friend Natalie; Jack and Natalie are registered and now appear in Emily's friends list; suppose now that Jack carries out a survey of 0.75 USD of bonus, after 4 working days the bonus of 0.75 USD is paid to Jack's account, that's when GreenPanthera gives Emily 10% of said bonus, clarifying that said bonus of the 10% don't leave the account of Jack, they leave the same platform, that is, of GreenPhantera; that is, Jack receives his promised $ 0.75 and Emily receives $ 0.075, both win and none are disadvantaged; now to explain what the system of referrals of a level will allow us to give an example with Natalie:<br/><br/>
As we said at the beginning, Emily invites Natalie, and suppose that Natalie, in turn, invites her handsome cousins ââPeter and Andrew; now suppose that Emily, Natalie, Peter and Andrew each carry out a survey with a bonus of 1.0 USD, this time Jack is on vacation and doesn't do any survey; suppose that this time, after 3 days, all the bonuses are paid, being as follows: Peter and Andrew get $ 1 each; Natalie receives 1 USD because of her own survey and she receives $ 0.1 of a 10% bonus from Peter and also receives $ 0.1 of 10% bonus from Andrew, receiving a total of $ 1.2; finally, Emily, receives USD 1.0 due to the survey itself which responded and receives USD 0.1 of the 10% bonus from Natalie, receiving a total of USD 1.1; as you realized here, Emily has no relation with Peter and Andrew since the system of referrals in GreenPanthera is of a single level, that's to say, Emily receives bonus by Natalie, because Emily invited directly to Natalie but not to Peter and Andrew. We hope that the example has served you.</p>

<h2>Registration and Profile</h2>
<br/>
<section class="informacion">
<p>The registration process in GreenPanthera is very simple, being the first step enter your e-mail and the password you want, as well as accept the conditions of use, mentioned above.</p>
</section>
<img class="ima" src="../img/ingles/gp3.png" title = "Register in GreenPanthera" alt = "Register GreenPanthera">
<section class="informacion">
<p>If you want to register and go to the par with the explanation you can click on the following button with which you can make the registration as shown in the previous image:</p>
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
<p>Once you've entered the e-mail and password, a confirmation link will arrive to your e-mail, so the second step will be to enter your e-mail and click on the link.</p><br/><br/>
<p>Afterwards, once you enter your GreenPanthera account you can complete your profile by filling in your personal information; in case you don't see the form for entering your data, just click on <forte>Personal account</forte> or your balance, and then click on <forte>Personal data</forte>. Here we present the recommendations to take into account when filling your profile, we'll try to be as clear as possible and exemplify everything we can:</p><br/><br/>
<p>The main thing that you should know is that companies in their marketing studies are looking to survey their potential customers, that's, consumers, if in our profile we've not drink, not even a glass of water, that we spend locked in our home without exercise and we hate brushing our teeth, we'll certainly receive very few surveys, so we'll list important aspects to take into account when filling your profile and surveys.
<br/><br/>
If you don't have a PayPal account, don't worry, you can leave the space blank and then fill it, at the bottom of the page, we explain how to create an account in PayPal, specifically, in <forte>Frequently Asked Questions</forte>.
</p>
</section> 
<img class="ima" src="../img/ingles/gp4.png" title = "GreenPanthera Profile" alt = "Profile GreenPanthera">
<section class="informacion">
<p class="linkextra">Age:</p> Above 26 is fine. Although GreenPanthera allows the registration of people over 18 years of age, the purchasing power of an 18-year-old person in most cases is less than the purchasing power of a 30-year-old, and for this reason, age influences both the receive surveys.<br/><br/>
<p class="linkextra">Education:</p> The professional degree is fine, the important thing is to demonstrate that we're in the capacity to acquire and buy different products; as well as demonstrate that having an acceptable purchasing power, we've enough experience to give our opinion on different brands, products and services.<br/><br/>
<p class="linkextra">Marital status:</p> Married or civil marriage; this is important, because when surveyed, clients, ie, those who do the surveys, will be interested in surveying people heads of households; in many cases, in the prequalification questions, we'll be asked if we're the ones who make the decisions when making the purchases, being advisable to say that we're the ones who decide what services and products to buy.
<br/><br/>
<p class="linkextra">State of occupation:</p> Permanent work or temporary work make up a good profile because in this way we guarantee to have an income with which to access the products offered or demonstrate that we've an income that has allowed us to have services or products of which they want to have our opinion.<br/><br/>
<p class="linkextra">In which industry is employed:</p> Anyone is well, we must be careful never to say that we work or that our relatives work in marketing, advertising companies or product brands since this way we'll not receive surveys. This is because, assuming that a person receives a survey of a company and that person is part of the marketing team of a rival company, he'll be tempted to respond to erroneous information; this is basically the reason, we hope you've understood the idea.<br/><br/>
<p class="linkextra">Members of the family:</p> Your partner, a couple of children and you're more than great. In many prequalification questions we'll be asked if we've children and in many also we'll be asked to give the dates of birth of each member, if you don't have children; we recommend "imagine" them and write down in a block their supposed dates of birth as well as that of all the members of your family, real or fictional, is your choice; from time to time will appear surveys on diapers and other products related to infants or young children.<br/><br/>
<p class="linkextra">Family income:</p> Again it has to do with the purchasing power we've, being a good value, from 100,000 USD, one hundred thousand dollars, annually.<br/><br/>

<h2>How to access the surveys?</h2>
<br/>
<section class="informacion">
<p>To the surveys you can access in two ways, the first is through your own e-mail reviewing the inbox, you'll receive e-mails inviting you to carry out the different surveys that you can access by clicking on the link that's indicates to you in the e-mail. It is worth clarifying that when opening an e-mail you'll find two links, the first, much longer than the second will be the one that redirects you to the survey and the second link is to cancel the subscription.
<br/><br/>
The second method to access the surveys is through the option <forte>Earn money</forte>, as we've indicated in the segment of Interface, being wrong to make use of it.</p>
</section>
</div>
<!-- ..........................................Recomendaciones.......................................... -->
<div class="pres animated slideInUp">
<br/>
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<br/>
<section class="informacion">
<p>Again we insist that you've patience, may not meet the profile needed in some <strong>surveys</strong> but you should know that won't a reason to be pessimistic, so our most important recommendation is to be positive and persevering.
<br/><br/>
Regarding the pre-qualification questions we repeat the aforementioned, the surveys are aimed at people of consumption, thinking about it, we can only access a few surveys if we say that we don't drink, that we don't exercise, that in our home we're not the ones who decide what to buy, that we don't have a car and that we don't intend to buy or rent a new one and countless examples like these; we hope to have been clear and the message was understood, even so, as you answer this type of questions you'll realize what modifications to make in the future. We also recommend that you always be consistent in all surveys, because if we give each survey different information, sooner or later we'll be blocked; that's, the information you give in the surveys is consistent with the data in your profile, which is why, if we're attentive when answering the surveys, there is nothing to worry about.
<br/><br/>
We must also clarify, and this same you can check when you read the e-mails with the links of the surveys that arrive in your inbox, that the surveys are closed once the number of subjects surveyed is met, times after four hours the survey will remain open as well as there will be times when the survey will close after 10 minutes, so you should not worry about entering the survey and it is closed.
<br/><br/>
As a final recommendation we invite you to enjoy everything you do, not only referring to answering surveys, but absolutely everything, you enjoy going for a walk as well as going to the supermarket to buy groceries, smile at life and life will smile at you , you'll realize that you'll experience much better your day to day.

<div class="pres animated slideInUp">
<br/>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<br/>
<section class="informacion">
<p class="linkextra">How to receive more surveys? </p><p>The first thing is to understand that we'll receive surveys that fit our profile, that's, if we've a good profile, referring to what you already know, that's, to consume; we'll have more surveys; something very important is also that in some occasions after a survey will generate a form where we can write more information about us being very important to fill out those forms.<br/><br/>
</p>
<p class="linkextra">How long does the bonus take? </p><p>From our experience we can tell you that in some cases it takes from 1 to 2 days, as there are occasions when it can take up to 2 weeks; this varies according to the amount of information because the information we give is corroborated, which is why it took up to 2 weeks.<br/><br/>
</p>
<p class="linkextra">How to know that the bonus came? </p><p>Entering your account from the GreenPanthera platform you can see your current balance and clicking on Transactions you'll be listed the bonuses you've received; we'll also be notified via e-mail every time we get boned by a survey.<br/><br/>
</p>
<p class="linkextra">Are all possible surveys notified by e-mail? </p><p>Not all, it is recommended that you enter the platform and review the available surveys by clicking on <forte>Earn money</forte> because many times new surveys are generated and we don't receive notification in our e-mail.<br/><br/>
</p>
<p class="linkextra">What kind of surveys do they get? </p><p>Of all kinds, mainly product research, asking us for different brands and also services; as well as asking about habits and preferences.<br/><br/>
</p>
<p class="linkextra">What are pre-qualification questions? </p><p>These are the questions we're asked in a survey to determine if we're good study subjects for the specific survey; that is, we can enter a survey, ask a couple of questions and according to the answers we give, we can access the survey or not; here also applies what we've said before, being a person of consumption, we'll be more likely to be able to access the survey, however, on many occasions we'll not be able to qualify surveys being this the most normal, which is why there is no why bother or be discouraged. We also recommend having patience because most of the time the prequalification questions are the same questions that you filled in your profile, this is because the clients, that is, those who perform the surveys, seek consistency in the answers and aren't taken to the light the information we give; Finally it is worth noting that in the pre-qualification questions it'll never take more than 5 minutes to answer them as it would be unfair to invest 30 minutes in prequalification questions to finally be disqualified.<br/><br/>
</p>
<p class="linkextra">When to respond to surveys? </p><p>If possible, it is best to respond to a survey shortly after receiving it, since the surveys have limited space and if we leave to respond to a survey 3 days after receiving it, there won't be the slightest possibility of accessing it.<br/><br/>
</p>
<p class="linkextra">How long does a survey take? </p><p>It usually takes 10 to 15 minutes, although there are also surveys that say that it takes 40 minutes but easily and unhurriedly they can be answered in 25 minutes; here we must take special care to be always attentive and to read what we're asked, since there will often be questions that will determine if we're really attentive.<br/><br/>
</p>
<p class="linkextra">What happens if the information I give is not concise? </p><p>By giving information that won't concise, they can lock the account; we recommend that the information be concise with your profile.<br/><br/></p>
<p class="linkextra">If I don't live in accepted countries can I use VPN? </p><p>We don't recommend it because if you use a paid or free VPN service you'll be using an IP address of a country that's accepted, until then everything is fine, the problem is that you'll not be the only one to use this new IP address, since that there will be many more people with <strong>GreenPanthera</strong> account making use of the same IP address. Well we could say that yes you can use VPN but we would only be taking advantage of your good intentions, however we invite you to continue browsing my-money.online, surely find something that you like and that you can do with total security.<br/><br/>
</p><p class="linkextra">How many surveys a day? </p><p>We can't tell you a specific number because the number of surveys will depend, as you know, on the information that you've put in your personal data as well as the country, what we can say is that the minimum of encustas that reach the e -mail is about 5 surveys, clarifying that they arrive at different times, for example, 2 in the morning, 1 at noon and 2 in the afternoon; this apart from the surveys that you can access directly from your account on the GreenPanthera platform, that is, in the option <forte>Earn money</forte>.<br/><br/>
</p><p class="linkextra">I don't have PayPal account </p><p>No problem, the first thing you've to do is go to the PayPal page, we don't provide the link for your own security, once there, at the top you'll find the following options:<br/>
